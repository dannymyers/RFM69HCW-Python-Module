Function Descriptions

Note: Work in Progress!!!

Intro: Below is a list of the module functions so far that I've developed.  
Most of the functions are for setting the various parameters for the radio,
2 for transmit and receive, 1 to get the last RSSI value and 1 to get the 
temperature via the radios temperature sensor.

transmit(transmitData, addressOn=False, address=0,packetLength=64) 
– function to transmit data from the radio.  

- transmitData: data to be transmitted, should be in string format
- addressOn: if true an address byte will be added to the data to be sent
- address:  the address byte to be sent if any address is being sent
- packetLength:  length of packet radio is expecting to send, if fixed length
mode is used this should match the payload length parameter the radio is using

receive(timeout=999, background=False) – function to receive data sent to the radio

- timeout: length of time the radio should stay in receive mode,  a value of -1 
will leave the radio in receive mode indefinately.  To cancel the radio out of 
receive mode early set the radio objects receiveTimeout variable to 0.
- background – a value of False will leave the receive function inline with your
 program, i.e. you program won't progress past the receive function until the 
timeout length is reached. A value of True will put the receive function into 
the background via a seperate thread so your program can proceed past the receive
 function and do other stuff while the gathing receive data.

All received data is put into the radio object's receiveData[] list.

last_rssi() - this function returns the last received signal strength indicator
stored in the radio's rssi register (RegRssiValue)  - this will be an integer 
value in dBm

temperature()  - this function will return the temperature obtained from the 
radio's temperature sensor – this will be an integer value.  Note: the 
temperature sensor will likely need to be calibrated against a know temperature.  
The radio object has a temperatureOffset variable that will need to be set. 
This can be done with the set_temperature_offset() function.
